###### `ic_channel_text`

Themes the `#` in top bar beside the channel name, doesnâ€™t theme the name though sadly.

##### Notes

- You can always use [Juby210's discord-jadx](https://gitdab.com/Juby210/discord-jadx/src/branch/alpha/app/src/main/res/drawable) repo, and also for Wingio's Custom Badges plugin, simply search whatever you want and filter out by `ic_profile_badge` if you were looking for profile badges.

- It's best to theme full white solid colored icons like `ic_emoji_picker_category_nature` (leaf emoji).
